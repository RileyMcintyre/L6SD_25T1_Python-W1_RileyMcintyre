basics of python 
Exercise 1 - Write a Simple Calculator that takes user input for two numbers, takes the two numbers, and adds the two and prints the result. Repeat for subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Exercise 2 - Create a Python script that checks if a given number is even or odd. Print a message indicating the result.
Exercise 3 - Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age. Implement a condition to check if the person is eligible to vote (18 years or older). Print an appropriate message.
Exercise 4 - Given the expression a = 5 * 2 + 3, calculate the value of ‘a’ using operator precedence. Explain the steps in a comment in your code.
Exercise 5 - Implement a program that prompts the user for two numbers and an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /). Use nested if-else statements to perform the operation and print the result. Handle division by zero appropriately.
User Input:
Input Prompt:
Write a program that takes the user's name as input and prints a personalized greeting.
Numeric Input:
Create a program that asks the user to enter two numbers and calculates their sum.
Favorite Color:
Prompt the user to enter their favorite color and display a message acknowledging their choice.
Output:
Print Multiple Lines:
Write a program that prints a message on one line, and then on the next line, prints a different message.
Formatted Output:
Create a program that prints a sentence with placeholders for the user's name and age.
Repeated Output:
Print the message "Hello" five times using a loop.
Variables:
Variable Swap:
Swap the values of two variables and print the result.
Variable Concatenation:
Concatenate two strings stored in variables and print the combined string.
Variable Initialization:
Declare a variable to store your age and initialize it with your actual age.
Operators:
Arithmetic Operations:
Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Comparison Operators:
Create a program that compares two numbers and prints whether they are equal or not.
String Concatenation:
Concatenate two strings and print the result.
Control Flow:
If-Else Statement:
Write a program that takes a user's age as input and prints whether they are eligible to vote or not.
Nested If Statements:
Implement a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
Looping Control Flow:
Use a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10
